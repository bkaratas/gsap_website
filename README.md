A modern single-page website built with **React**, **Vite**, and **GSAP**.  
The project demonstrates advanced scroll-triggered animations, modular architecture, and best practices for building performant front-end applications.

## Overview

This repository was created to explore how **GSAP** can be integrated into a **React + Vite** workflow.  
Animations are structured in a reusable and modular way, separating concerns between UI components and animation logic.  

The site is deployed using **Netlify**, with automated builds configured via `netlify.toml`.

---

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** – Component-based UI development  
- **Vite** – Development server and build tool for optimized production output  
- **GSAP 3** – High-performance JavaScript animation library  
- **ScrollTrigger** – GSAP plugin for scroll-based interactions  
- **ESLint** – Code linting and style consistency (`eslint.config.js`)  
- **Netlify** – Hosting and CI/CD for automatic deployment  
- **CSS3** – Styling with modern layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid)
